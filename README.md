# [Project 1: Exploratory Analysis of Palmer Penguins Data Set Overview]

*https://github.com/carlo7236/Carlo_Portfolio/blob/main/Project_Penguins.ipynb

* Found a set of variables (2 quantative, 1 qualitative) that were predictive of a Penguins Species
* Cleaned/Prepared data by removing columns, renaming columns, and splitting the data into a train and test set for later use
* Conducted an exploratory analysis which consisted of summary statistics and visualizations such as a scatterplot, histogram, and boxplot

* Performed an automated feature selection using Logistic Regression in order to find a set of variables best predictive of species
* Imported three machine learning models (SVM, LR, and KNN) and compared each ones performance by finding the best parameters and using confusion matrices  
* Compared each models performance via decision regions and discussed them in detail in the discussion section

# [Project 2: Exploratory Analysis of Video Game Data Set]

This project was made for fun and because I am really interested in gathering insights from video game data. This data set was imported from Kaggle and contains information ranging from 1985-2016. The data set includes information on video game genre, console, critic score, global sales and more. I analyzed the data set using basic statistics (summary tables and heat map) and found some correlation between sales in different countries.

Finally, I created some visualizations using matplotlib in order to determine what genres were most popular on the different consoles in the data and found that shooters predominatly sold well on the Xbox 360. Moreover, sports genre did best on the Nintendo Wii which can likely be contributed to the Wii but no correlation can be made.
