Portfolio composed of coding projects done in class settings/personal projects
# Project 1: Exploratory Analysis of Palmer Penguins Data Set
* The goal of this project was to find a set of variables (2 quantative, 1 qualitative) that were predictive of a Penguins Species
* Cleaned/Prepared data by removing columns, renaming columns, and splitting the data into a train and test set for later use
* Conducted an exploratory analysis which consisted of summary statistics and visualizations such as a scatterplot, histogram, and boxplot
* Performed an automated feature selection using Logistic Regression in order to find a set of variables best predictive of species
* Imported three machine learning models (SVM, LR, and KNN) and compared each ones performance by finding the best parameters and using confusion matrices  
* Compared each models performance via decision regions and wrote a discussion based on what went wrong
