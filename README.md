# Carlo_Portfolio
Portfolio composed of coding projects done in class settings/personal projects
# [Project 1: Exploratory Analysis of Palmer Penguins Data Set] (https://github.com/carlo7236/Carlo_Portfolio)
* The goal of this project was to find a set of variables (2 quantative, 1 qualitative) that were predictive of a Penguins Species
* Cleaned/Prepared data by removing columns, renaming columns, and splitting the data into a train and test set for later use
* Conducted an exploratory analysis which consisted of summary statistics and visualizations such as a scatterplot, histogram, and boxplot
* Performed an automated feature selection using Logistic Regression in order to find a set of variables best predictive of species
* Imported three machine learning models (SVM, LR, and KNN) and compared each ones performance by finding the best parameters and using confusion matrices  
* Compared each models performance via decision regions and wrote a discussion based on what went wrong 

# [Project 2: Exploratory Analysis of Video Game Data Set (In-progress)] (https://github.com/carlo7236/Carlo_Portfolio)
* The goal of this project is to explore a set of video game data ranging from 1985-2016
* This data set was imported from kaggle and can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/the-console-wars-ps-vs-xbox-vs-wii/notebook
* Cleaned/Prepared data by removing NaN values & converting User_Score into a str type 
* Created a summary table composed of different stats (mean, std, min, max) in order to look for insights on data 
* Investigated different correlations through a correlation table and illustrated via a heat map
* Illustrated findings through different visualizations such as a histogram and bar graph
* To be continued...
